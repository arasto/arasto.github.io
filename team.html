      Astha Rastogi (Founder and CEO) <br>
      Hola! I'm Astha. I am a junior at William Mason High School. My passion for a vast variety of languages is truly what defines myself. As a people's person, I have always had a drive for what I consider to be 'languages': music, visual and fine arts, mathematics, English, Hindi, and Spanish.
      My growing passion for these languages continues to spark new endeavors for Sab√≠a Learning Lounge. Apart from managing Sabia, I am trilingual (Spanish, Hindi, English) and enjoy serving as the Vice President of Mason's Spanish National Honor Society.
      I have also frequently traveled to Costa Rica and India. These experiences have not only enlightened me with street-level knowledge of Spanish and Hindi but also understand in-depth one of the many cultural identities behind them.
